<p>Having a homestead there are many structures that can be of use, and are often even needed.  The following structures are the ones I plan on having as a part of my homestead.

<ul>

<li>Greenhouse</li>

<li>Chicken house</li>

<li>Goat/Sheep/Cow Structure</li>

<li>Hay Shed</li>

<li>Tool Shed</li>

<li>Barn With a Feed Room</li>

</ul>

<p>As of right now I do have the tool shed, Goat shelter, and two chicken coops, but I would like to make my structures more efficient and safe for my animals and myself.</p>
