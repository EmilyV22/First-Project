<h2>Garden</h2>

<p>In this section I would like to talk about what I want to grow in my garden. I would like to grow things such as:</p>

<ul>

<li>Tomatoes</li>

<li>Cucumbers</li>

<li>Zucchini</li>

<li>Peppers (both hot and mild)</li>

<li>Green beans</li>

<li>Winter Squash</li>

</ul>

<p>Honestly that is a very small list compared to everything that I could grow, but those are pretty much the staples. Anything else is pretty much just for fun. I do enjoy occasionally throwing in something that I wouldn't normally grow. It helps to keep thing interesting. It also helps to include different varieties of the staples. I especially love all the varieties of tomatoes that are available.</p>
