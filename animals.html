<h2>My Animals</h2>

</header>

<p>The animals I want on my homestead are as follows:<p>

<ul>

<li>Chickens</li>

<li>Ducks</li>

<li>Goats</li>

<li>Rabbits</li>

<li>Sheep</li>

<li>Cows</li>

<li>Pigs</li>

</ul>

<p>Obviously if you are going to have all that livestock, you need a livestock guardian dog to protect them.  That's what I have Dixie for. At least that's what she was supposed to be for. I didn't do the best job training her, so she doesn't do her job the way I would like. I hope as she gets older, she will get better, and I won't have to worry about her so much.</p>

<p>I would also like to get horses in the future, but those are kind of an end of the line kind of thing. Horses are really expensive with not much output, so if you get horses, you better have the money to pay for them. They also usually require a lot more care, and that includes vet visits. With the other animals, you are more likely to be able to take care of their medical needs on your own, but with horses, you get a massive vet bill. All that being said I would still like to get horses one day, just not today.</p>
